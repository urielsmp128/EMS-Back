## Introduction
**EMS-Back** is a backend service built with Java and Spring Boot, designed to power an Employee Management System (EMS). This service handles all business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints necessary for managing employee data, and roles.

## Features
- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employee data.
- **Role Management**: Assign and manage roles.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Hibernate**
- **MySQL** (or any other relational database)
- **Maven**

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/urielsmp128/EMS-Back.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash

3. **Configure the database**
   - Update the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your database settings.
